# 🎶 Music Database Analysis Project

Welcome to my **Music Database Analysis Project**! This project delves into customer spending, artist popularity, top genres, and various insights from a dataset using **SQL**. 

Through complex queries involving **Joins**, **Window Functions**, **Subqueries**, and **Aggregate Functions**, I've explored customer behavior, artist trends, and genre preferences, providing business insights for music-related decision-making.
